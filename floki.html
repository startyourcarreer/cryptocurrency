<h2>History of FLOKI</h2>
<p>FLOKI, also known as Floki Inu, was inspired by Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog named Floki. The project began in June 2021, following a tweet from Musk about his pet. Initially launched as a meme coin, FLOKI aimed to capture the playful and community-driven spirit of Dogecoin while adding its unique twist. The project was initially started by an anonymous developer who later abandoned it. However, the community rallied together, took over the project, and relaunched FLOKI. This strong community involvement has been a defining characteristic of FLOKI, often referring to themselves as the "Floki Vikings." FLOKI operates as a multi-chain token on both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains. This dual-chain approach allows for greater flexibility and accessibility for users. FLOKI also incorporates a 3% tax on transactions, which is directed to the project's treasury to fund further development and adoption. FLOKI's journey from a meme-inspired cryptocurrency to a robust ecosystem is marked by innovation, community support, and strategic development. Its history reflects the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency world, showcasing the power of community-driven projects.</p>
