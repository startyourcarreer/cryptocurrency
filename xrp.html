<h2>History of XRP</h2>
<p>XRP was created by three engineers—David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto—in 2011. They aimed to develop a more efficient and sustainable digital asset compared to Bitcoin, specifically designed for payments. Their work led to the creation of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which officially launched in June 2012. Initially, the project was called Ripple, and the digital asset was referred to as "ripples" (XRP). The founders gifted 80 billion XRP to a new company, which was initially named NewCoin, then OpenCoin, and eventually rebranded to Ripple Labs. Chris Larsen joined as CEO, and the team focused on building use cases for XRP within the financial system. Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, the XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol based on the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). This allows for faster and more energy-efficient transactions, with the ledger capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. </p>
